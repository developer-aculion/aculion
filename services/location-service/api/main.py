Full spatial feature engineering + AI recommendation engine.

v3.2 — POI category density legend reworked to a FIXED set of 17 main
  business verticals, each with its OWN calibration constant.
  - Added MAIN_CATEGORY_MAP: every granular POI sub-category returned by the
    SQL layer (e.g. "Mall", "Department Store", "Supermarket", "Restaurant",
    "Cafe", ...) is now folded into exactly one of 17 canonical legend
    buckets: real_estate, fitness, food_dining, shopping, home_furnishing,
    fashion, office, electronics, retail, commercial, automotive,
    healthcare, banking_finance, residential, education, entertainment,
    travel_tourism.
  - Added EXPECTED_MAX_DENSITY_MAIN + _K_MAIN: a SEPARATE, independently
    calibrated half-saturation constant (k) per legend category, instead of
    reusing the old fine-grained per-sub-category EXPECTED_MAX_DENSITY table.
    Each category's k is chosen from a realistic "typical max density"
    for THAT vertical specifically (e.g. residential POIs cluster far
    denser per km² than, say, real estate offices), so "score = 63" always
    means "at that category's own half-saturation density", never a
    borrowed threshold from an unrelated vertical.
  - build_poi_distribution() rewritten: it now aggregates raw poi_counts
    into these 17 buckets FIRST (summing every sub-category that maps to a
    given bucket), computes ONE area-normalized density per bucket, then
    runs that density through _saturate() with the bucket's own k. The
    legend/chart therefore always has exactly 17 rows (in the same order,
    every time), each independently scaled by its own formula.
  - Categories with no mapping (Government, uncategorized "Others") are
    excluded from the legend entirely, per requirements — they are not one
    of the 17 requested legends.
  - All other KPI math (compute_features, compute_kpis,
    compute_road_analytics, the LLM recommendation hookup, endpoints) is
    UNCHANGED from v3.1; this release only touches the POI category density
    component.

v3.1 — KPI layer mathematically reformulated.
  - Every KPI in compute_kpis() and every sub-score in compute_road_analytics()
    is now a CONVEX COMBINATION (non-negative weights summing to exactly 1.0)
    of sub-scores that are bounded in [0,100] BY CONSTRUCTION — either via the
    canonical _saturate() transform on a raw density/count, or because the
    quantity is already a genuine percentage of a physical total (e.g. land
    use area). This guarantees analytically, not defensively, that every KPI
    stays in [0,100].
  - Removed every remaining ad hoc `min(raw_value * constant, 100)` clip that
    used to live INSIDE compute_kpis / compute_road_analytics. Those clips
    each re-derived their own inconsistent scaling of the SAME raw metric
    (poi_density, road_density, junction_density, competition_index) with a
    hard "cliff" at the cap. Now every KPI references the ONE canonical score
    for that metric (poi_density_score, road_density_score,
    junction_density_score, competition_index, transit_accessibility, ...),
    computed exactly once in compute_features() and threaded through.
  - Fixed an oversight: poi_density_score / road_density_score /
    junction_density_score were being computed inside compute_features() (to
    build walkability) but never included in its returned dict, so
    compute_kpis() and compute_road_analytics() could not actually reach them
    and were silently falling back to re-deriving raw-value clips instead.
    They are now part of the returned features payload.
  - ai_confidence reformulated: the old formula gave a dead 10-point bonus
    for `metro_count > 0`, but metro_count is permanently fixed at 0
    elsewhere in this module (metro stations intentionally excluded), so
    that term could never fire. Replaced with a smooth, three-signal convex
    combination (POI count coverage, road-data presence, transit signal),
    each passed through _saturate() instead of a binary flag or hard cap.
  - compute_road_analytics() reworked the same way: connectivity, traffic
    density, road quality, and public transport are now convex combinations
    of the canonical bounded scores (road_density_score,
    junction_density_score, transit_accessibility, walkability) plus two
    genuinely distinct ABSOLUTE-scale signals (total road length in km, and
    absolute bus+rail count) that are deliberately kept separate from their
    area-normalized counterparts, each smoothed via _saturate().

v3.0 — Location-agnostic release.
  - Removed all hardcoded Chennai-only bounding-box restrictions. The API now
    analyzes ANY latitude/longitude the user selects on the map.
  - Progressive radius expansion (1x -> 5x) and an area-name centroid fallback
    ensure sparsely-mapped locations (e.g. peri-urban suburbs at the edge of
    table coverage) still return meaningful features instead of all zeros.
  - The AI reasoning layer (see llm_recommendation.py) reasons over a much
    broader set of business verticals derived from the full detected POI mix,
    instead of defaulting to Retail/FMCG/Dining.
  - commercial_density / competition_index reformulated as absolute,
    area-normalized, saturating-curve scores instead of "share of total local
    POI mix" ratios, which used to collapse toward zero for any location not
    dominated by a handful of specific categories (see _saturate() below).

v2.1 — Rebalanced weighting model (banking, offices, shopping, transit now
  drive the majority of commercial/footfall scoring; hotels split out of the
  transit bucket into their own category).

        score(x) = 100 * (1 - e^(-x / k))

    Replaces two brittle patterns that used to live throughout this module:
      1. "share of total POI mix" ratios (count / total_pois * 100), which
         collapse toward zero for any location whose POI mix isn't dominated
         by the specific categories being measured — even if that location
         has a healthy absolute number of those POIs.
      2. hard linear caps (min(x * const, 100)), which create a "cliff":
         a location just below the cap threshold and one just above it can
         score wildly differently for a negligible real difference, and every
         location beyond the threshold is indistinguishable at a flat 100.

    Properties, all satisfied by construction:
      - score(0)  = 0           -> genuinely no data reads as 0, honestly.
      - strictly increasing     -> more presence is never penalized.
      - score(k)  ~ 63.2        -> reaching the half-saturation density k
                                    already earns a solid majority score.
      - score(3k) ~ 95.0        -> diminishing returns past that, no
                                    discontinuous plateau at a hard cap.
      - continuous & C-infinity -> no cliffs; nearby inputs give nearby
                                    scores.

    k is the half-saturation constant: the density/count at which a location
    earns ~63/100. Different metrics/categories use DIFFERENT k values,
    calibrated to that metric's own typical/expected max, so "63" always
    means "reached this category's own realistic reference density" and
    never borrows a threshold from an unrelated metric or category.

    Monotonic power-curve rescale, used ONLY on compounded KPIs (currently
    overall_score) where a plain weighted average of several _saturate()
    sub-scores stacks two layers of compression on top of each other.

    PROBLEM THIS SOLVES:
    overall_score is a convex combination of sub-scores (commercial_density,
    transit_accessibility, poi_density_score, competition_index, ...) that
    are THEMSELVES already saturating curves over raw densities. Real-world
    raw densities are usually well below each sub-score's calibrated k, so
    each sub-score often lands in the 20-50 range on its own. A weighted
    AVERAGE of several such 20-50 values can never exceed the average of its
    inputs — so overall_score inherits the same compressed range and
    clusters under 40 even for genuinely decent locations. This is not a
    bug in any one formula; it's the mathematical consequence of averaging
    multiple already-compressed curves.

        expand(x) = 100 * (x / 100) ** gamma,   0 < gamma < 1

    Properties (same discipline as _saturate() — no ad hoc clip):

      - expand(100) = 100   -> a maximal input still reads 100.

# not a borrowed threshold from some other category. This means "reached
# 63/100" always means "hit this vertical's own reference density".
